jqTerminal
==========

A Unix-like terminal, written in Javascript.

###Try it out!

You can try a demo of the console [here] (http://fdemian.github.io/jqTerminal/ "JQTerminal Demo").

###Code Conventions

- Tabs should not be used. 
- Indentation must use 2 spaces.
- The curly braces at the start and end of functions must go on their own line. Exceptions are cases when doing this results in a javascript error.


###Code structure

Code is organized as follows (this is likely to change in the near future): 

- CSS: contains the styles for the terminal itself, and the bootstrap CSS files. 
- Files: contains audio/image files used in the examples. 
- Fonts: as of the moment, only contains bootstrap fonts. 
- js: Javascript files. 
- jQTerminal: the application code itself.
- License: BSD-2 Clause license. 
- Index.html : brief introduction. 
- ParkAdministration.html: example that emulates the terminal used in the first jurassic park movie. 
- Tutorial.html: a not-so-brief tutorial on how to use this application.
