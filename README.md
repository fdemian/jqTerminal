###Try it out!

You can try a demo of the console [here] (http://fdemian.github.io/jqTerminal/ "JQTerminal Demo").

###Code Conventions

- Tabs should not be used. 
- Indentation must use 2 spaces.
- The curly braces at the start and end of functions must go on their own line. Exceptions are cases when doing this results in a javascript error.
