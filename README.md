==========

A Unix-like terminal, written in Javascript.

###Try it out!

You can try a demo of the console [here] (http://fdemian.github.io/jqTerminal/ "JQTerminal Demo").

###Code Conventions

- Tabs should not be used. 
- Indentation must use 2 spaces.
- The curly braces at the start and end of functions must go on their own line. Exceptions are cases when doing this results in a javascript error.

###Code structure

The code is organized as follows: 

- css: contains the styles for the terminal itself, and the bootstrap CSS files. 
- docs: contains documentation and examples of use. 
- fonts: as of the moment, only contains bootstrap fonts. 
- js: Javascript files. 
- jQTerminal: the application code itself.
